# Interview Script (Two Speakers)

**Interviewer (H)**: Welcome back! Today we’re unpacking last season’s data and previewing next year. Thanks for joining.

**Guest (G)**: Happy to be here. Let’s dive in.

**H**: First up—areas of biggest improvement?

**G**: Three standouts. (1) Transition defense tightened—opponents’ fast-break points dropped notably. (2) Assisted shot creation ticked up, improving shot quality. (3) Late-game execution improved: fewer empty trips in the last two minutes.

**H**: Most improved player by goals-per-game delta?

**G**: Player M saw the steepest rise in goals-per-game compared with last season, driven by better off-ball movement and set-play usage.

**H**: Who was clutch in one-possession games?

**G**: Player R. In close games, R’s net plus-minus and on-ball creation were best-in-team, and they converted late free-throws at a high rate.

**H**: For two extra wins, offense or defense?

**G**: Defense. Our model shows a stronger marginal win impact from reducing opponent second-chance points and live-ball turnovers. I’d tighten defensive rebounding schemes and outlet discipline.

**H**: One data-informed rotation tweak?

**G**: Pair Player M and R in staggered units to maintain shot creation without sacrificing spacing. Bench units gain a stabilizer without overloading starters.

**H**: Any outliers skewing averages?

**G**: Yes—top 5% scorers inflate mean scoring. Using the median or trimming top 5% gives a truer central tendency for role-player evaluation.

**H**: Turnovers down by 25–50%—what changes?

**G**: Emphasize two-hand catches on kick-outs, simplify ATO sets in crunch time, and add a rule: no leave-your-feet passes. Also, drill touch-post entries to reduce strips.

**H**: What chart should we show?

**G**: A **waterfall chart** for win attribution (rebounding, turnovers, pace), and a **boxplot** to compare scoring distributions with/without outliers.

**H**: Thanks for the insights!

**G**: My pleasure.
